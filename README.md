Simple tracker for a work day that remembers created entries, shows how far in the day you are and shows past, present and future to-do's

## Description

PRIMARY GOAL: Allow the user to track their daily work for the work day

WHAT HAPPENS:
 
- Time is displayed at the top of the page
- Each hour has a text box and a save button. Typing in the box and pressing saves stores that value as what you have to do that hour
- Past hours cannot be changed and have a grey background
- Present hours can be changed and have and orange background
- Future hours can be changed and have a green background

## Usage

This can be used as a very simple daily to-do list. The values are all stored on your browser so you can leave the page and come back without losing your list.

It is also mobile friendly and is ready for use.
